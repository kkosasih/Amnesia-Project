Statement:0|0|Neymour|Surprised|What?! How dare you think that!! Of course it is! You're just blind to the issue.||
Statement:0|0|Best Friend|Serious|Well, to support my friend, there just isn't enough evidence to suppose that Sherri's posession is linked to the Pandora's box myths.|| 
Statement:0|0|Best Friend|Serious|By all means, I understand how you came to that logic. After all, since it looks like magic is normal, we can't just link two magical things as if they are similar because they might be completley different.|| 
Statement:0|0|Best Friend|Serious|I'm not saying you're wrong, but I'm saying that we can't make any conclusions yet.||
Statement:0|0|Neymour|Serious|Hmmm . . . you do have a good point there, my friend. You do.||
Statement:0|0|Best Friend|Serious|You may or may not be right. We'll see. Just because you're not right, doesn't mean you're wrong.||

Statement:0|0|Best Friend|Neutral|Oh! How weird.||
Statement:0|0|Neymour|Neutral|It is. But let me know what you two find out after you open it later. I'm curious.||

Question:0|0|Same.|YOU make me concerned!
