/*The files under the folder named "Prototypes" are just prototype assets for the game. They will not be used for the final version 
of the game, but served as a way to test things that deal with art assets.
The dimensions of the assets will vary, but for the most part, it goes as follows:
  - Character Standing/Walking/Running/etc: 16 x 24 px
  - Character Portraits: 100 x 100 px (for now)
  - Tiles: 32 x 32 for 1 tile
